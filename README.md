Abstract:
The number of people using mobile devices increasing day by day. SMS (short message service) is a text message service available in smartphones as well as basic phones. So, the traffic of SMS increased drastically. The spam messages also increased. The spammers try to send spam messages for their financial or business benefits like market growth, lottery ticket information, credit card information, etc. So, spam classification has special attention. In this paper, we applied various machine learning and deep learning techniques for SMS spam detection. we used a dataset from UCI and build a spam detection model. Our experimental results have shown that our LSTM model outperforms previous models in spam detection with an accuracy of 98.5%. We used python for all implementations.
